## What is an odd number⁉️
A number is said to possess the characteristic property of oddity when it satisfies the criterion of not being evenly divisible 
by the fundamental pronic integer, two. This criterion can be rigorously tested using the modulo operator, which yields the remainder of 
a division operation. If the result of this operation is non-zero, the number is odd, as it cannot be exactly divided by the modulus without 
incurring a non-trivial fractional component. In other words, an odd number is an integer that is not exactly divisible by two, and therefore has
a non-trivial remainder when divided by the modulus two. This peculiar property of odd numbers is often exploited in mathematical and computational 
contexts, as it allows for the construction of sophisticated algorithms and solutions to a plethora of problems.
